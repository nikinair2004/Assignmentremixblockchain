Blockchain Assignments – Decentralized Applications
Assignment 1: Smart Contract Development & Testnet
Deployment
Objective: Understand how to develop, compile, and deploy smart contracts.
Task:
1. Research & Set Up:
○
Install a smart contract development environment (Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle).
○
Find out how to deploy contracts on an Ethereum testnet (Goerli, Sepolia, or
Mumbai for Polygon).
○
Configure MetaMask and obtain a test ETH (find a faucet yourself).
2. Write & Deploy:
○
○
○
Write a simple Solidity smart contract that stores and retrieves a value.
Deploy the contract on the testnet (without instructor help).
Test transactions using MetaMask or a blockchain explorer.
3. Submit:
○
○
Contract code, testnet deployment details, and transaction hash.
A short report explaining what challenges you faced.
Assignment 2: Creating & Deploying Your Own ERC-20
Token
Objective: Learn how to create and deploy an ERC-20 token.
Task:
1. Research & Set Up:
○
Understand ERC-20 token standards and how real-world tokens work.
○
Find out how to deploy ERC-20 contracts on an Ethereum testnet.
2. Token Development:
○
Write a Solidity contract for an ERC-20 token with:
■ Total supply, minting, burning, and transfer functions.
3. Deploy & Test:
○
○
4. Submit:
Deploy the token on a testnet and test transfers.
Verify the contract on Etherscan or a similar explorer.
○
○
Token contract code, testnet deployment address, and transaction details.
A short report explaining the tokenomics (supply, fees, minting process).
Assignment 3: Decentralized Voting System
Objective: Build a secure decentralized voting system.
Task:
1. Research & Design:
○
Study existing blockchain-based voting systems.
○
Decide whether to use Ethereum, Polygon, or Hyperledger Fabric.
2. Development:
○
Implement a smart contract that allows users to:
■ Register as voters.
■ Cast votes securely.
■ View real-time election results.
3. Deploy & Submit:
○
○
Deploy the contract on a testnet.
Submit a report on security measures and challenges faced.
Assignment 4: NFT Marketplace Development
Objective: Create an NFT marketplace with a Web3 frontend.
Task:
1. Research & Setup:
○
Learn about ERC-721 and NFT metadata.
○
Find out how to store NFTs using IPFS or another decentralized storage
system.
2. Development:
○
Create an ERC-721 contract for minting NFTs.
○
Build a web interface (React, Next.js, or Vue.js) for minting and listing NFTs.
3. Deploy & Test:
○
Deploy on a testnet and interact using MetaMask.
4. Submit:
○
○
NFT contract code, Web3 integration screenshots, and testnet deployment
details.
A short report explaining the marketplace mechanics.
5. Hyperledger Fabric – Setting Up a Private Blockchain
Network
Objective: Learn how to install and run a permissioned blockchain network.
Task:
1. Research & Set Up:
○
Find out how to install Hyperledger Fabric on your system.
○
Set up a Fabric network using Docker Compose (without instructor help).
2. Smart Contract (Chaincode) Deployment:
○
Write and deploy a simple chaincode (smart contract) to store and retrieve
assets.
3. Test & Document:
Test interactions with the network using the Fabric CLI or an SDK.
○
4. Submit:
○
○
A short setup guide explaining your process.
Screenshots showing the running network and smart contract execution.
Bonus Challenges (For Extra Marks)
1. Hyperledger Fabric & IoT Integration
●
●
Simulate an IoT sensor that records data on a private Hyperledger Fabric network.
Implement access control so only authorized users can view data.
2. Smart Contract Security Audit
●
●
Find a real Ethereum smart contract and analyze it for security vulnerabilities.
Document three security flaws and propose fixes.
3. Cross-Chain Token Bridge
●
Research and develop a simple cross-chain bridge for transferring tokens between
Ethereum and Polygon.
